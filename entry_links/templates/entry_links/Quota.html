<p>
    Due to this study's interactive nature, unfortunately at this time we cannot accept you into the experiment due to
    either of the below reasons (that were stated on the study description and the consent information):
    <ul>
    <li>
        Based on the number of participants who showed up, we had to send some of the participants to reach a specific
        number.
    </li>
    <li>
        We had slightly over-recruited to make sure we reach a specific number of participants.
    </li>
    <li>
        We do not have enough participants to start the experiment.
    </li>
</ul>
</p>



<p>
    Note that <b>you can wait (on this page) a few more minutes</b>  â€” if a space in the experiment frees up at the last
    minute, we can offer it to you if you are still here on this page.
</p>

<p>
    We will be publishing new scheduler studies over the next couple of weeks. Please keep an open eye as you may find
    another slot that would fit your schedule. Now, please <b>return your submission on Prolific by selecting the 'Stop
    without completing' button</b>. "Returning" your submission will ensure that you will stay eligible to attend a
    future session.
</p>

<p>
    If you have arrived <b>within the first 3 minutes</b> of the study start time, we will still
    compensate you with <b>$0.5</b> upon returning your submission.
</p>
