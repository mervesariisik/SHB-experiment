    You will now be presented with several Situations, each asking you to make a choice between two options:
    <ol>
    <li>
        <b>50-50 Lottery</b> between 40 points or 0 points (each equally likely)
    </li>
    or
    <li>
        <b>Fixed Payoff</b> of a specific number of points
    </li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
When you have made all your choices, the computer will randomly select one Situation to determine your earning from this
part.
</p>
<p>
    In the selected Situation: if you chose the 50-50 Lottery, the computer will randomly pick 40 points or 0 points and if you
chose the Fixed Payoff, you will receive the specified number of points.
</p>

<p>
For every point you earned in the selected Situation, you will get $0.05. Your earnings from this part will be added to
    your fixed reward and your earnings from other parts.
</p>

<p>
    Note that you will have <b>up to 3 minutes</b> to submit <u>all your choices</u>. <i>In the case that you don't
    submit your choices within the allotted time, the computer will submit random choices.</i>
