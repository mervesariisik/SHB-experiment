<p>
    We will start with "Guessing the Secret Number" Game. You will play <b>{{Constants.num_rounds}} rounds </b> of this
    game.
</p>

<p>
    This game involves two roles: an <b>Observer</b> and a <b>Guesser</b>. Roles are randomly determined before the game
    begins and will be <u>fixed</u> throughout the entire game. You are <u>equally likely</u> to be assigned to either
    role. You will see your assigned role when the game begins.
</p>
<p>
    <u>Each round</u>, the computer will randomly pair you with a participant in the other role. You will NOT know which
    participant you are paired up with.
</p>

<p>
    Note also that, before the game begins, participants are put into 2 different Zoom breakout rooms based on their
    randomly assigned roles. Therefore, you will never be paired with a participant from your Zoom breakout room.
